The Tabs Indicator Plugin is an extension to the jQueryUI Tabs Widget. Essentially, it piggy-backs off of the Tabs Widget.

This plugin was inspired by the Economist App which has a series of dots along the bottom of multi-page content. The active page is noted by a different style.
To navigate to another page, you simply tap the dot - which selects that page and changes the styles accordingly. 

This plugin binds to all of the Tabs UI events: tabsselect, tabsload, tabsshow,tabsadd, tabsremove,tabsenable & tabsdisable. Whatever actions you perform on the 
tabs, those actions will be reflected in the indicator. For example, if you disable the second tab, the second indicator will be disabled as well. Optionally, you
can elect to hide the tabs and just use the tab indicator as your method of navigation. By default, the tabs are displayed. 

To load the plugin: 

$('#tabs').tabs().tabindicator();

To load the plugin and to suppress the tabs display:

$('#tabs').tabs().tabindicator({displayTabs: 'hide'});

This plugin is designed to allow you to interact with the tabs widget like you always have. This plugin will simply respond to the events the tabs widget raises.

This plugin incorporates ThemeRoller so that any styles you choose, whether they are from an existing template or custom, this plugin will reflect those styles
so long as your theme is ThemeRoller compliant. For demo purposes, I've included the ui-lightness and ui-darkness themes. example1.html uses the ui-darkness theme and
example-2 uses the ui-lightness theme.

Required files:

tabindicator.js
tabindicator.css

To make your existing tabs widget capable of using this plugin and displaying the indicators, you must add the following HTML:

<div class="tabIndicatorContainer"></div>

The following is an example of a tabs widget that incorporates the tabIndicatorContainer DIV:

		<div id="tabs">
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#tabs-1">First</a></li>
				<li><a href="#tabs-2">Second</a></li>
				<li><a href="#tabs-3">Third</a></li>
			</ul>
			<div id="tabs-1">Page 1</div>
			<div id="tabs-2">Page 2</div>
			<div id="tabs-3">Page 3</div>
			
			<div class="tabIndicatorContainer"></div>
			
		</div>


Also, there is a test fixture which should provide additional guidance on usage. You can find that material in the /tests folder.

Enjoy..
